            <p>It has been such a long time since we have seen your <random-text char-count="6">redacted</random-text> face, and you have not aged a second. How peculiar... we could congratulate you by saying "keep up whatever you have been doing" but that would be outright deception. We really don't want our reunion in <random-text char-count="3">redacted</random-text> years to be based on lies now wouldn't we.</p>
            <p>However let us welcome you back. Properly. It rarely hurts, only <random-text char-count="3">redacted</random-text> subjects have reported side effects only. Please sit still.</p>
