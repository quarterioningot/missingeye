This is not how I feel, nor who I am. This is a state of mind that rekindles memories of ever growing thoughts. The anxious mind stays awake thinking and pondering, till there is nothing to think and ponder about anymore. Sleep tonight and think of nothing else except the descent into peaceful familiarity.
