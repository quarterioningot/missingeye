                <h2>We are human</h2>

                <p>It all started when two separate human beings wanted to create a new smaller human. This new human would then slowly grow and mature into a larger human.</p>

                <p>While the new human grew and gained their own personalities, likes and dislikes, they also integrated into society with other beings which gave them a myriad of new opportunities to explore. As the unforgiving time ticked away they learned and absorbed everything until clarity had set upon their busy minds.</p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>

                <p>We can neither prove that destiny exists nor disprove it. The evidence simply does not yet exist. The past should be set in stone, the present is continuously unfolding. While the future remains a mysterious and complex infinity, like a mandelbrot set of vast depths which never seem to end.</p>

                <p>Our minds constantly shifts from one idea to the next and suddenly onto a hundred others. They focus by becoming distracted, chasing new ideas and purposes until one reveals an enticing path.</p>

                <p>Purpose is not given to one. Purpose is not real. It cannot be real. If things change constantly then ones purpose changes along with it. Purpose is but a figment of a persons consciousness.</p>

                <h2>Who</h2>

                <p>We do not know who, maybe who is us and who is you. That answer is at current time unclear. Can you hear the bells ringing? Maybe that is who it is. An empty space surrounded by lanky walls of imposing spires. The bells toll a dreadful chime and the walls are getting taller.</p>

                <p>None feel safe. We must retreat to and ponder about what lies ahead.</p>
