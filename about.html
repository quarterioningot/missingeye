            <p>These are the ramblings of echoing minds that live as one, they utter random words in attempt to communicate. Do not engage in conversation with them. The experiment is ongoing and outside collaboration may cause <random-text char-count="8"></random-text>.</p>

                <h2>We are human</h2>

                <p>It all started when two separate human beings wanted to create a new smaller human. This new human would then slowly grow and mature into a larger human.</p>

                <p>While the new human grew and gained their own personalities, likes and dislikes, they also integrated into society with other beings which gave them new opportunities to explore. As the unforgiving time ticked away they learned and absorbed until clarity had set upon their busy minds.</p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>

                <p>Destiny does not exist. We can neither prove it or disprove it. The evidence simply does not exist. The past is set in stone, the present is unfolding. While the future is tree with branches that reach vast lengths and are never ending.</p>

                <p>Our minds constantly shifts from one idea to the next and suddenly onto a hundred others. They focus by becoming distracted, chasing new ideas and purposes until one reveals a path.</p>

                <p>Purpose is not given when a human becomes real. Purpose is not real. It cannot be real. If things change constantly then the purpose changes along with it. Thus purpose is not real but only a figment of time as it passes by.</p>

                <h2>Who</h2>

                <p>We do not know who... Maybe who is us and who is you. That answer is unclear. Can you hear the bells ringing? Maybe that is who it is. An empty space surrounded by tall walls, as the bells toll their audible energy reflects and creates a cacophony of reflections until their sound dies down.</p>

                <p>They will retreat in thought and ponder about who. Maybe you... maybe we, unsure.</p>
